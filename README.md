# Marginal Revolution Scraped Blog Post Data Analysis

This repo is simply a Jupyter Notebook analyzing data from blog posts scraped
from [Marginal Revolution](www.marginalrevolution.com). In March 2018, I scraped
the website to get all of the posts, including comments. I'm going to see how
much intelligence I can gather through the posts, using as many tools at my
disposal as I can. 

You can find the corresponding blog series [here](http://www.marknagelberg.com/lets-scrape-a-blog-part-1/).
